/**
	Implements a basic variable buffer.

	Variable buffers are defined in GLSL/SPIR-V as a shader storage buffer, and DX as a RWStructuredBuffer.

	Provides a list of offsets per variable into the buffer, which is oblivious of whether or not
	the variable is used in any shader, although variable buffers are usually directly mappable from CPU memory.

	Also provides a size and aligned size, the aligned size being a layout specific padded size,
	while size is just the plain byte size. If the aligned size is primitively implemented, then
	it will be the same as the ordinary size.
